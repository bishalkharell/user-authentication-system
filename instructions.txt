1. Configure Settings for Sending Email Notification after Registering

    Go to emailSender/Settings and configure with requirements...

    Example with gmail..
        EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
        EMAIL_PORT = 587
        EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'youremailhere'  #example -->something@gmail.com / something@hotmail.com
        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ' Your Email Password'  
        EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
        EMAIL_USE_SSL = False

    Depending on the host you are using settings might be different.
    Make sure 'less secure app' is on in gmail to get access.





2. Views configure
    Visit auth_users/views --> send_email() function
    Replace 'youremail@something.com' with original Email
    Others also can be modified depending on requirements....

3. Initializing email properties
    uncomment send_email(request) from register() function.
